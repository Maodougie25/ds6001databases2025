    "Many database systems run as external software on a computer. Some of the software is commercial (Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server), with limited free use and expensive enterprise level licenses. Other database software is entirely free and open source (MySQL, Postgres, SQlite, MongoDB). Regardless of whether the software is free or not, databases are notoriously difficult to install and start using. More than other kinds of software, database systems seem to run into many errors that are specific to the operating system of your computer. We used to ask students to install Postgres, MySQL, and Mongo, and it was a nightmare because everyone hit some sort of roadblock and those roadblocks were different for every student.\n",

    "The schema set up in 2NF still has transitive dependencies keeping it from meeting 3NF requirements, where non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes rather than directly on the primary key.\n",
    "In the Drugs table, if drug_maker determines drug_cost (e.g., pricing is tied to the maker), then drug_cost depends transitively on the key.\n",
    "In the Physicians table, the hospital and hospital_location should not depend directly on the physician — they depend on the hospital itself.\n",
