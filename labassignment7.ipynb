    "I think we teach a few subjects all wrong. The first class in statistics, for example, usually applies hypothesis testing to dumb and unrealistic examples, and involves looking-up p-values in the back of a heavy textbook. Of course this dissuades many potential statisticians from pursuing the subject. But if we instead placed the focus on probability, experimentation, and prediction and applied the methods to fun or interesting examples like games and current science, then we would make the subject much more appealing in its own right, and not just due to its associations with high income employment.\n",

    "I think database work and SQL get a similarly bad treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a universal language for interacting with relational databases. MySQL, SQlite, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft, and every other relational database management system uses SQL to connect to data. SQL can be run inside Python, R, Javascript, and many other interpretive programming languages. It is the single best language for collaboration. It is far older than most programming languages yet is still in the [top 12 most frequently used languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), and [30% of all data science job listings](https://365datascience.com/career-advice/data-scientist-job-market/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=web&utm_campaign=blog&utm_content=2024-job-market&utm_term=article) explicitly list SQL. But industry has done all it can to portray SQL as a barrier to entry, largely through the prevalence of SQL proficiency exams as part of data science job interview processes. The SQL exam is inescapable and scary. And every time I teach this course, I get many understandable requests for more SQL practice questions. Students want to do more SQL to pass the SQL job interview exam, but we've lost something important here: placing the emphasis on the exam misses the fact SQL is one of the very best mechanisms we have in data science for answering questions with data. If you have a database that covers a subject you care about, then you will find that SQL provides you with a working vocabulary to speak to the database as if you are speaking to a sage.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, many of you will be facing a SQL exam in the near future. So, you need to practice SQL. A lot. More than you can in this one homework assignment. Fortunately, there are some websites that can help you prepare with deep test banks of relevant SQL-based sample interview questions. Just keep in mind that while the examples you will see on these websites may reasonably strike you as dumb, SQL will be a lot more enjoyable if you find data that matches your interests. \n"

Lee, like many young developers, found the riddles tedious and mostly irrelevant to the work coders might actually do on the job. What was the point? What if they built a program that hid AI from browsers during remote job interviews so that interviewees could cheat their way through instead?\n",

Use your own words, please: we care about your opinions, not your grammar. \n",

Although Lee's motives may be wrong, he's right about the importance of AI. I'm eager to see how his technology would work and if that will shape how interviews are conducted in the future.

    "Now we will use the Shakespeare DB to answer some questions that come from the academic research on Shakespeare's work.

    "[Lucas Erne (2013)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Shakespeare_as_Literary_Dramatist/hppMS0sy7CQC?hl=en&gbpv=0) argues that Shakespeare wrote his plays for the stage and also for the written page, abridging the works for stage adaptation. This thesis is controversial because Shakespeare has been viewed as a playwright writing for live audiences rather than as an author writing for posterity, and Erne challenges that conception. One theory is that as Shakespeare experienced greater levels of success, he viewed himself more through the lens of his own legacy, and wrote later works in a more literary way than earlier works, producing works of greater length. \n",

    "Shakespeare's plays were grouped into the broader genres of histories, tragedies, and comedies by a group of his colleagues for the publication of 36 of his plays in the [First Folio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Folio) in 1623. [Whissell (2007)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.101.1.177-192?casa_token=xa_qe0gK0dAAAAAA:0AXMiqTBAyLkdVdk2X8J1w7drv7nRxV34ZUfTc4c9x1u2lED-ae_s67KHg_pqAQYlbLgD-kIg7kjLA) analyzes how Shakespeare used word choice, specifically when conveying emotion and imagery, to connote genre. Specifically, Whissell finds that comedies more frequently than tragedies use words associated with \"pleasantness\", such as bright, kinder, rapt, satisfied, success, virtues, wise, hero, love, hope, and relief. (The full dictionary of works associated with pleasantness, activation, and imagery is [here](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/papers/dict_of_affect/DictionaryofAffect))\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a SQL query that calculates whether each line of dialogue from every Shakespeare work contains one of these words associated with pleasantness, then calculates the proportion of total lines of dialogue from each work that contain a pleasantness word, then averages these proportions across genres to test whether there is a difference between tragedies and comedies. We will again do this together, step-by-step (though the steps are bigger ones in this problem)."

    "[Note: in the steps laid out in this problem, you might reasonably think we can first join the parapgraph and works tables, then create the `pleasant_line` average, so as to avoid using a subquery or a common table expression. The reason why this approach doesn't work is because we've renamed a column to `pleasant_line` from a very complicated default name, but this alias name is not understood by PostgreSQL until the query is executed, so we would have to use the complicated name when collapsing the data to genres. Instead, by using a subquery or CTE, the first part of the query is executed and saved, along with the column alias, for use in the second part of the query.]\n",

    "[Champion (1976)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27796535) analyzes the soliloquies in Hamlet. A soliloquoy is a speech that a character gives  in which they speak to themselves. These speeches represent a character's inner thoughts and internal monologue. In Hamlet, Champion notes that the soliloquoys represent \"Hamlet's inner struggle. The devices of internalization, for example, are far more extensive than in the earlier tragedies. More important, the clue to Hamlet's personality is to be found in the quite unique manner in which the playwright utilizes these devices to reveal the complexity of this inner man.\"\n",

    "* In this case, `wordcount` in the paragraphs table measures the length of speeches, so use this column. But in general if we did not have this column, we could use the `LENGTH()` clause in SQL to count the number of characters in each text value.\n",
    "* To see the maximum value of a column, you can sort with `ORDER BY` with the `DESC` clause, then use `LIMIT 1` to show only the first value.\n",
    "* The output of `pd.read_sql_query()` is stored as a Pandas dataframe. To extract the first value of a column named `plaintext` and to print it in a readable way, you can write: `print(pd.read_sql_query(myquery, con=engine)['plaintext'][0])` in Python, outside the SQL code.\n",
